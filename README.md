# Keras-Learning-Curve
Using the Fashion MNIST dataset we will train a Keras Sequential model, plotting a confusion matrix and learning curve.

This was created using Jupyter notebook installed under Anaconda 3.7.
Matplotlib version 3.1.0 (3.1.1 has some bugs in plotting)
Latest version of TensorFlow (2.1.0) was used.
